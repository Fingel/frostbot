Welcome to the Anvil! You should now have access to all of the Anvil Raid Team channels.

Anvil Officers will post signup reminders and announcements on discord, so make sure to familiarize yourself with the channels and pay close attention to any updates.

Also, all raid signups are done on anvilgrobbulus.com. If you plan on raiding it is important that you register on the site and sign up each week otherwise we cannot promise you that your spot will be saved.

For more information about the Raid, make sure to check the #raid-rules channel and the #news-and-updates channel.
