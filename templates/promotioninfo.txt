All new members of the guild start as **Recruits**. Any alts will be marked as **Reserves**.

Promotions can only happen at a guild meeting. We will hold a guild meeting every second wednesday. (If there is no way you can make a Wednesday meeting, please contact an officer and we can figure out an alternative for you!)

After one month of membership in the guild, Recruits are promoted to **Grunt**.

After two months of membership in the guild, Grunts can choose their Path of specialization. There are four Paths:

**Harbinger (PvP)**
**Lorekeeper (RP)**
**Emissary (Social/Community)**
**Vanquisher (Raiding)**

Regardless of the Path you choose, you can still participate in anything you want! This is just a way to self-identify, whether its for your character from an RP point of view, or as just a way to note what you focus on as a player.

Lastly, exceptional long time members will be promoted to **Frost Guard** as a reward for their unwavering dedication to the guild. This will happen at the Officersâ€™ discretion.
