Welcome to the Frostwolf Militia! May you find glory in battle and bring honor to both the Horde and the Militia!

**As a new member we ask that you read the following:**

As a Frostwolf you now have access to all of our guild Discord channels, including those for both of our raid teams. (The Hammer and the Anvil) We use Discord to socialize and organize many events, so make sure to familiarize yourself with the different channels.

You can change your nickname to your character’s name (right click your name and select Change Nickname)

All Frostwolves are asked to download the Group Calendar addon (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/group-calendar-for-classic) . This is an in-game calendar where we often schedule guild events.

We have guild meetings once every two weeks, usually on Wednesdays at 6 Server Time. Guild meetings are not required, but you are strongly encouraged to participate. It’s a great opportunity to socialize with other Frostwolves and keep up to date with any new developments and news in the guild.

As a new recruit you are just beginning your journey with the <Frostwolf Militia>. Members are promoted at guilld meetings after one and two months of membership. Please type **!PromotionInfo** for more information on Promotions and Ranks.
